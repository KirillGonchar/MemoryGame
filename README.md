# Build a memory game

Build a memory game in React.

You start with 12 images that you will display as 24 cards. By default, they are "flipped" - you only get a placeholder instead of the image.

As the user clicks a "card", flip it around, revealing the image.
When the user clicks the same picture twice, in a row, then it means he has a match - so keep the images visible from then onwards.
